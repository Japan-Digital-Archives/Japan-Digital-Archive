                <target>This beta version of the Digital Archive of Japan's 2011 Disasters is the result of an ongoing global collaborative effort. Its ever-expanding content represents the contributions of an array of individuals and organizations variously affected by the unprecedented events of March 2011 and their aftermath. The development of the archive interface has been led by the Edwin O. Reischauer Institute at Harvard University in collaboration with metaLAB (at) Harvard, Harvard's Center for Geographic Analysis and Zeega.org, a non-profit creative technology company. This current version lays the groundwork for an ever-evolving and ultimately participatory archive. The interface is built using Zeega, an open-source platform that supports initaitives in crisis archiving, enabling anyone to create participatory projects that combine original content with photos, videos, text, audio, data feeds and maps via APIs from across the web.</target>

                <target>A project of Harvard University’s Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies, the Digital Archive of Japan's 2011 Disasters is an evolving, collaborative space for citizens, researchers, students, and policy makers, and a site of shared memory for those most directly affected by these events. The digital archive is an advanced search engine for materials from all over the web, individuals’ testimonials, tweets, and content from international partners who are building digital repositories about the disasters. The site not only facilitates searching of materials, but allows users to create curated collections and interactive presentations on topics of interest to them. Collections and presentations can be shared publicly and enhance the value of the various items accessible through the archive. The archive also features an innovative map feature that visualizes all materials that are tagged with geographic information in real time.</target>

This project, employing a unique interviewing style called kikigaki, was launched in July 2011 jointly by the Tokyo Foundation and the Kyouzon no Mori Network, an NPO dedicated to promoting sustainable lifestyles. Over the course of a year, 47 interviewers—members of the two groups, along with students and other project members—visited 101 people living in evacuation centers and temporary homes to 
conduct one-on-one interviews. These accounts are told entirely in the first person and have been transcribed verbatim (in the local dialect). Focusing on people’s work, family life, and community activities prior to the March 2011 disaster, they also serve as an important archive of information on community life in areas whose historical records were washed away. They not only provide insights into how lives should be rebuilt in tsunami-affected areas but also 
prompt those of us who were not affected to reflect on the way we live our lives and the values we hold, and could shed new light on the essential qualities of our society.The JDArchive contains hundreds of full-text Japanese interviews with disaster victims conducted by the "101 Voices from Tohoku" Project.</target>

				<target> (JDA) is an online portal to digital materials documenting the cascading series of natural and man-made disasters that began in Japan on March 11, 2011. Designed and maintained by the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies at Harvard University, the JDA relies on the support of partner organizations around the world to supply digital contents, including websites, tweets, video, audio, news articles, and much more. The JDA does not store copies of the data; rather it seamlessly links to digital materials archived by partner projects, allowing you to search, view, and sort items across separate archives and collections in one interface.

Please submit websites in any language that relate to the disasters and their aftermath. Fill out the form as completely as possible, including choosing the appropriate scope and frequency for our harvesting of the site. Scope refers to the depth of the harvesting - should we only harvest the front page, or the entire site? Frequency determines how often we harvest the site. For example, if the site is updated often, please choose a weekly or monthly frequency so we can keep our preservation of the website up to date. Upon submission, websites will be reviewed by an archivist before appearing in the archive.</target>

				<target>Our search is only as good as the information we have about the items in our archive. Tagging an item with keywords helps users find items in the archive that are relevant to their searches. Tags are especially valuable for items like photos, audio, and video, that do not have “full text” that can be searched. To add a tag, simply click on the red “add a tag” link in the item’s pop-up page, enter your tag, and press Enter/Return on your keyboard. Tags cannot be deleted once added, so please double check your spelling before entering. Please tag the items you find in your searches and help us improve our archive!</target>

Every translation contributed by our users adds value to the archive by allowing speakers of other languages to understand that item. Any item can be translated into any language, so please feel free to add a translation in your native language!</target>

				<target>The “My Collection” feature allows users to organize materials discovered in the archive into a miniature “exhibition” of materials under a certain topic or theme. By curating a collection, you are establishing connections between the items according to your own criteria, and offering others a new perspective on the disaster. You might organize items by theme, place, time, or any other criteria you can imagine. You can also use the function to save items of personal interest to make it easier for you to access them later on.</target>
